  <h1>The Origin Of Chess</h1>
he precursors of chess originated in northern India during the Gupta empire, where its early form in the 6th century was known as Chaturanga.
This translates as 'the four divisions', meaning infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn,
 knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<br><br>

Persian and Arabic chess
In Sassanid Persia around 600 the name became Chatrang and the rules were developed further, and players started calling Shāh! (Persian for 'King')
when threatening the opponent's king, and Shāh māt! (Persian for 'the king is finished') when the king could not escape from attack.
These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.<br><br>

The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names; in Arabic "māt" or "māta" مَاتَ means "died",
"is dead". In Arabic, the game became Shatranj. In all other languages, the name of the game is derived either from shatranj or from shah.<br><br>

Changes in names of pieces
The following table provides a glimpse of the changes in the names and character of chess pieces, as they passed from one culture to another, from India through Persia to Europe
Changes in the Arabic names of pieces happened over several centuries after the game arrived in Europe. Most changed were the pieces which had no equivalent in Europe, such as the elephant,
the visier (an advisor: the firzan or wazir), and the chariot (rukhkh).<br>
The greatest variety of names was for the elephant,[1]p424 which was not seen in Europe, and so not used in war.<br>
In Spain names derived from Arabic lasted for centuries (alfil, aufin, orfil...). Eventually, all but France used a word for "bishop". In a similar manner,<br>
vizir eventually became "queen", and the chariot became a word for "castle". Except, that is, in English, where "rook" is obviously a version of "rukh".
